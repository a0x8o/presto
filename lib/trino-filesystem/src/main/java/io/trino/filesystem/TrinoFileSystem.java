/**
 * TrinoFileSystem is the main abstraction for Trino to interact with data in cloud-like storage
 * systems. This replaces uses HDFS APIs in Trino.  This is not a full replacement of the HDFS, and
 * the APIs present are limited to only what Trino needs. This API supports both hierarchical and
 * blob storage systems, but they have slightly different behavior due to path resolution in
 * hierarchical storage systems.
 * <p>
 * Hierarchical file systems have directories containing files and directories. HDFS and the OS local
 * file system are examples of hierarchical file systems. The file path in a hierarchical file system
 * contains an optional list of directory names separated by '/' followed by a file name. Hierarchical
 * paths can contain relative directory references such as '.' or '..'. This means it is possible
 * for the same file to be referenced by multiple paths.  Additionally, the path of a hierarchical
 * file system can have restrictions on what elements are allowed.  For example, most hierarchical file
 * systems do not allow empty directory names, so '//' would not be legal in a path.
 * <p>
 * Blob file systems use a simple key to reference data (blobs). The file system typically applies
 * very few restrictions to the key, and generally allows keys that are illegal in hierarchical file
 * systems. This flexibility can be a problem when accessing a blob file system through a hierarchical
 * file system API, such as HDFS, as there can be blobs that cannot be referenced. To reduce these
 * issues, it is recommended that the keys do not contain '/../', '/./', or '//'.
 * <p>
 * When performing file operations, the location path cannot be empty, and must not end with a slash
 * or whitespace.
 * <p>
 * For directory operations, the location path can be empty, and can end with slash.  An empty path
 * is a reference to the root of the file system.  For blob file systems, if the location does not
 * end with a slash, one is appended, and this prefix is checked against all file locations.
 */
// NOTE: take care when adding to these APIs.  The intention is to have the minimal API surface area,
// so it is easier to maintain existing implementations and add new file system implementations.
