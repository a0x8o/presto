# Iceberg connector

```

Apache Iceberg is an open table format for huge analytic datasets. The Iceberg
connector allows querying data stored in files written in Iceberg format, as
defined in the [Iceberg Table Spec](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/). The
connector supports Apache Iceberg table spec versions 1 and 2.

The table state is maintained in metadata files. All changes to table
state create a new metadata file and replace the old metadata with an atomic
swap. The table metadata file tracks the table schema, partitioning
configuration, custom properties, and snapshots of the table contents.

Iceberg data files are stored in either Parquet, ORC, or Avro format, as
determined by the `format` property in the table definition.  The default
`format` value is `PARQUET`.

Iceberg is designed to improve on the known scalability limitations of Hive,
which stores table metadata in a metastore that is backed by a relational
database such as MySQL.  It tracks partition locations in the metastore, but not
individual data files.  Trino queries using the {doc}`/connector/hive` must
first call the metastore to get partition locations, then call the underlying
file system to list all data files inside each partition, and then read metadata
from each data file.

Since Iceberg stores the paths to data files in the metadata files, it only
consults the underlying file system for files that must be read.

## Requirements

To use Iceberg, you need:

- Network access from the Trino coordinator and workers to the distributed
  object storage.

- Access to a {ref}`Hive metastore service (HMS) <hive-thrift-metastore>`, an
  {ref}`AWS Glue catalog <iceberg-glue-catalog>`, a {ref}`JDBC catalog
  <iceberg-jdbc-catalog>`, a {ref}`REST catalog <iceberg-rest-catalog>`, or a
  {ref}`Nessie server <iceberg-nessie-catalog>`.

- Data files stored in a supported file format. These can be configured using
  file format configuration properties per catalog:

  - {ref}`ORC <hive-orc-configuration>`
  - {ref}`Parquet <hive-parquet-configuration>` (default)

## General configuration

To configure the Iceberg connector, create a catalog properties file
`etc/catalog/example.properties` that references the `iceberg`
connector and defines a metastore type. The Hive metastore catalog is the
default implementation. To use a {ref}`Hive metastore <hive-thrift-metastore>`,
`iceberg.catalog.type` must be set to `hive_metastore` and
`hive.metastore.uri` must be configured:

```properties
connector.name=iceberg
iceberg.catalog.type=hive_metastore
hive.metastore.uri=thrift://example.net:9083
```

Other metadata catalog types as listed in the requirements section of this topic
are available. Each metastore type has specific configuration properties along
with {ref}`general metastore configuration properties
<general-metastore-properties>`.

The following configuration properties are independent of which catalog
implementation is used:

## Type mapping

The connector reads and writes data into the supported data file formats Avro,
ORC, and Parquet, following the Iceberg specification.

Because Trino and Iceberg each support types that the other does not, this
connector {ref}`modifies some types <type-mapping-overview>` when reading or
writing data. Data types may not map the same way in both directions between
Trino and the data source. Refer to the following sections for type mapping in
each direction.

The Iceberg specification includes supported data types and the mapping to the
formating in the Avro, ORC, or Parquet files:

- [Iceberg to Avro](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#avro)
- [Iceberg to ORC](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#orc)
- [Iceberg to Parquet](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#parquet)

### Iceberg to Trino type mapping

## Security

The Iceberg connector allows you to choose one of several means of providing
authorization at the catalog level.

(iceberg-authorization)=

### Authorization checks

You can enable authorization checks for the connector by setting the
`iceberg.security` property in the catalog properties file. This property must
be one of the following values:

```{eval-rst}
.. list-table:: Iceberg security values
  :widths: 30, 60
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Property value
    - Description
  * - ``ALLOW_ALL``
    - No authorization checks are enforced.
  * - ``SYSTEM``
    - The connector relies on system-level access control.
  * - ``READ_ONLY``
    - Operations that read data or metadata, such as :doc:`/sql/select` are
      permitted. No operations that write data or metadata, such as
      :doc:`/sql/create-table`, :doc:`/sql/insert`, or :doc:`/sql/delete` are
      allowed.
  * - ``FILE``
    - Authorization checks are enforced using a catalog-level access control
      configuration file whose path is specified in the ``security.config-file``
      catalog configuration property. See
      :ref:`catalog-file-based-access-control` for information on the
      authorization configuration file.
```

(iceberg-sql-support)=

## SQL support

This connector provides read access and write access to data and metadata in
Iceberg. In addition to the {ref}`globally available <sql-globally-available>`
and {ref}`read operation <sql-read-operations>` statements, the connector
supports the following features:

- {ref}`sql-write-operations`:

  - {ref}`iceberg-schema-table-management` and {ref}`iceberg-tables`
  - {ref}`iceberg-data-management`
  - {ref}`sql-view-management`
  - {ref}`sql-materialized-view-management`, see also {ref}`iceberg-materialized-views`

### Basic usage examples

The connector supports creating schemas. You can create a schema with or without
a specified location.

You can create a schema with the {doc}`/sql/create-schema` statement and the
`location` schema property. The tables in this schema, which have no explicit
`location` set in {doc}`/sql/create-table` statement, are located in a
subdirectory under the directory corresponding to the schema location.

Create a schema on S3:

```
CREATE SCHEMA example.example_s3_schema
WITH (location = 's3://my-bucket/a/path/');
```

Create a schema on an S3-compatible object storage such as MinIO:

```
CREATE SCHEMA example.example_s3a_schema
WITH (location = 's3a://my-bucket/a/path/');
```

Create a schema on HDFS:

```
CREATE SCHEMA example.example_hdfs_schema
WITH (location='hdfs://hadoop-master:9000/user/hive/warehouse/a/path/');
```

Optionally, on HDFS, the location can be omitted:

```
CREATE SCHEMA example.example_hdfs_schema;
```

The Iceberg connector supports creating tables using the {doc}`CREATE TABLE
</sql/create-table>` syntax. Optionally, specify the {ref}`table properties
<iceberg-table-properties>` supported by this connector:

```
CREATE TABLE example_table (
    c1 INTEGER,
    c2 DATE,
    c3 DOUBLE
)
WITH (
    format = 'PARQUET',
    partitioning = ARRAY['c1', 'c2'],
    sorted_by = ARRAY['c3'],
    location = 's3://my-bucket/a/path/'
);
```

When the `location` table property is omitted, the content of the table is
stored in a subdirectory under the directory corresponding to the schema
location.

The Iceberg connector supports creating tables using the {doc}`CREATE TABLE AS
</sql/create-table-as>` with {doc}`SELECT </sql/select>` syntax:

```
CREATE TABLE tiny_nation
WITH (
    format = 'PARQUET'
)
AS
    SELECT *
    FROM nation
    WHERE nationkey < 10;
```

Another flavor of creating tables with {doc}`CREATE TABLE AS
</sql/create-table-as>` is with {doc}`VALUES </sql/values>` syntax:

```
CREATE TABLE yearly_clicks (
    year,
    clicks
)
WITH (
    partitioning = ARRAY['year']
)
AS VALUES
    (2021, 10000),
    (2022, 20000);
```

### Procedures

Use the {doc}`/sql/call` statement to perform data manipulation or
administrative tasks. Procedures are available in the system schema of each
catalog. The following code snippet displays how to call the
`example_procedure` in the `examplecatalog` catalog:

```
CALL examplecatalog.system.example_procedure()
```

(iceberg-register-table)=

#### Register table

The connector can register existing Iceberg tables with the catalog.

The procedure `system.register_table` allows the caller to register an
existing Iceberg table in the metastore, using its existing metadata and data
files:

```
CALL example.system.register_table(schema_name => 'testdb', table_name => 'customer_orders', table_location => 'hdfs://hadoop-master:9000/user/hive/warehouse/customer_orders-581fad8517934af6be1857a903559d44')
```

In addition, you can provide a file name to register a table with specific
metadata. This may be used to register the table with some specific table state,
or may be necessary if the connector cannot automatically figure out the
metadata version to use:

```
CALL example.system.register_table(schema_name => 'testdb', table_name => 'customer_orders', table_location => 'hdfs://hadoop-master:9000/user/hive/warehouse/customer_orders-581fad8517934af6be1857a903559d44', metadata_file_name => '00003-409702ba-4735-4645-8f14-09537cc0b2c8.metadata.json')
```

To prevent unauthorized users from accessing data, this procedure is disabled by
default. The procedure is enabled only when
`iceberg.register-table-procedure.enabled` is set to `true`.

(iceberg-unregister-table)=

#### Unregister table

The connector can unregister existing Iceberg tables from the catalog.

The procedure `system.unregister_table` allows the caller to unregister an
existing Iceberg table from the metastores without deleting the data:

```
CALL example.system.unregister_table(schema_name => 'testdb', table_name => 'customer_orders')
```

#### Migrate table

The connector can read from or write to Hive tables that have been migrated to
Iceberg.

Use the procedure `system.migrate` to move a table from the Hive format to the
Iceberg format, loaded with the source’s data files. Table schema, partitioning,
properties, and location are copied from the source table. A bucketed Hive table
will be migrated as a non-bucketed Iceberg table. The data files in the Hive table
must use the Parquet, ORC, or Avro file format.

The procedure must be called for a specific catalog `example` with the
relevant schema and table names supplied with the required parameters
`schema_name` and `table_name`:

```
CALL example.system.migrate(
    schema_name => 'testdb',
    table_name => 'customer_orders')
```

Migrate fails if any table partition uses an unsupported file format.

In addition, you can provide a `recursive_directory` argument to migrate a
Hive table that contains subdirectories:

```
CALL example.system.migrate(
    schema_name => 'testdb',
    table_name => 'customer_orders',
    recursive_directory => 'true')
```

The default value is `fail`, which causes the migrate procedure to throw an
exception if subdirectories are found. Set the value to `true` to migrate
nested directories, or `false` to ignore them.

(iceberg-data-management)=

### Data management

The {ref}`sql-data-management` functionality includes support for `INSERT`,
`UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `MERGE` statements.

(iceberg-delete)=

#### Deletion by partition

For partitioned tables, the Iceberg connector supports the deletion of entire
partitions if the `WHERE` clause specifies filters only on the
identity-transformed partitioning columns, that can match entire partitions.
Given the table definition from {ref}`Partitioned Tables <iceberg-tables>`
section, the following SQL statement deletes all partitions for which
`country` is `US`:

```
DELETE FROM example.testdb.customer_orders
WHERE country = 'US'
```

A partition delete is performed if the `WHERE` clause meets these conditions.

#### Row level deletion

Tables using v2 of the Iceberg specification support deletion of individual rows
by writing position delete files.

(iceberg-schema-table-management)=

### Schema and table management

The {ref}`sql-schema-table-management` functionality includes support for:

- {doc}`/sql/create-schema`
- {doc}`/sql/drop-schema`
- {doc}`/sql/alter-schema`
- {doc}`/sql/create-table`
- {doc}`/sql/create-table-as`
- {doc}`/sql/drop-table`
- {doc}`/sql/alter-table`
- {doc}`/sql/comment`

#### Schema evolution

Iceberg supports schema evolution, with safe column add, drop, reorder, and
rename operations, including in nested structures. Table partitioning can also
be changed and the connector can still query data created before the
partitioning change.

(iceberg-alter-table-execute)=

#### ALTER TABLE EXECUTE

The connector supports the following commands for use with {ref}`ALTER TABLE
EXECUTE <alter-table-execute>`.

##### optimize

The `optimize` command is used for rewriting the active content of the
specified table so that it is merged into fewer but larger files. In case that
the table is partitioned, the data compaction acts separately on each partition
selected for optimization. This operation improves read performance.

All files with a size below the optional `file_size_threshold` parameter
(default value for the threshold is `100MB`) are merged:

```sql
ALTER TABLE test_table EXECUTE optimize
```

The following statement merges the files in a table that are under 10 megabytes
in size:

```sql
ALTER TABLE test_table EXECUTE optimize(file_size_threshold => '10MB')
```

You can use a `WHERE` clause with the columns used to partition the table, to
apply `optimize` only on the partitions corresponding to the filter:

```sql
ALTER TABLE test_partitioned_table EXECUTE optimize
WHERE partition_key = 1
```

##### expire_snapshots

The `expire_snapshots` command removes all snapshots and all related metadata
and data files. Regularly expiring snapshots is recommended to delete data files
that are no longer needed, and to keep the size of table metadata small. The
procedure affects all snapshots that are older than the time period configured
with the `retention_threshold` parameter.

`expire_snapshots` can be run as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE test_table EXECUTE expire_snapshots(retention_threshold => '7d')
```

The value for `retention_threshold` must be higher than or equal to
`iceberg.expire_snapshots.min-retention` in the catalog, otherwise the
procedure fails with a similar message: `Retention specified (1.00d) is shorter
than the minimum retention configured in the system (7.00d)`. The default value
for this property is `7d`.

##### remove_orphan_files

The `remove_orphan_files` command removes all files from a table's data
directory that are not linked from metadata files and that are older than the
value of `retention_threshold` parameter. Deleting orphan files from time to
time is recommended to keep size of a table's data directory under control.

`remove_orphan_files` can be run as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE test_table EXECUTE remove_orphan_files(retention_threshold => '7d')
```

The value for `retention_threshold` must be higher than or equal to
`iceberg.remove_orphan_files.min-retention` in the catalog otherwise the
procedure fails with a similar message: `Retention specified (1.00d) is shorter
than the minimum retention configured in the system (7.00d)`. The default value
for this property is `7d`.

(drop-extended-stats)=

##### drop_extended_stats

The `drop_extended_stats` command removes all extended statistics information
from the table.

`drop_extended_stats` can be run as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE test_table EXECUTE drop_extended_stats
```

(iceberg-alter-table-set-properties)=

#### ALTER TABLE SET PROPERTIES

The connector supports modifying the properties on existing tables using
{ref}`ALTER TABLE SET PROPERTIES <alter-table-set-properties>`.

The following table properties can be updated after a table is created:

- `format`
- `format_version`
- `partitioning`
- `sorted_by`

For example, to update a table from v1 of the Iceberg specification to v2:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name SET PROPERTIES format_version = 2;
```

Or to set the column `my_new_partition_column` as a partition column on a
table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name SET PROPERTIES partitioning = ARRAY[<existing partition columns>, 'my_new_partition_column'];
```

The current values of a table's properties can be shown using {doc}`SHOW CREATE
TABLE </sql/show-create-table>`.

(iceberg-table-properties)=

##### Table properties

Table properties supply or set metadata for the underlying tables. This is key
for {doc}`/sql/create-table-as` statements. Table properties are passed to the
connector using a {doc}`WITH </sql/create-table-as>` clause:

```
CREATE TABLE tablename
WITH (format='CSV',
      csv_escape = '"')
```

```{eval-rst}
.. list-table:: Iceberg table properties
  :widths: 40, 60
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Property name
    - Description
  * - ``format``
    - Optionally specifies the format of table data files; either ``PARQUET``,
      ``ORC`, or ``AVRO``.  Defaults to ``ORC``.
  * - ``partitioning``
    - Optionally specifies table partitioning. If a table is partitioned by
      columns ``c1`` and ``c2``, the partitioning property is ``partitioning =
      ARRAY['c1', 'c2']``.
  * - ``location``
    - Optionally specifies the file system location URI for the table.
  * - ``format_version``
    - Optionally specifies the format version of the Iceberg specification to
      use for new tables; either ``1`` or ``2``. Defaults to ``2``. Version
      ``2`` is required for row level deletes.
  * - ``orc_bloom_filter_columns``
    - Comma-separated list of columns to use for ORC bloom filter. It improves
      the performance of queries using Equality and IN predicates when reading
      ORC files. Requires ORC format. Defaults to ``[]``.
  * - ``orc_bloom_filter_fpp``
    - The ORC bloom filters false positive probability. Requires ORC format.
      Defaults to ``0.05``.
```

The table definition below specifies format Parquet, partitioning by columns
`c1` and `c2`, and a file system location of
`/var/example_tables/test_table`:

```
CREATE TABLE test_table (
    c1 INTEGER,
    c2 DATE,
    c3 DOUBLE)
WITH (
    format = 'PARQUET',
    partitioning = ARRAY['c1', 'c2'],
    location = '/var/example_tables/test_table')
```

The table definition below specifies format ORC, bloom filter index by columns
`c1` and `c2`, fpp is 0.05, and a file system location of
`/var/example_tables/test_table`:

```
CREATE TABLE test_table (
    c1 INTEGER,
    c2 DATE,
    c3 DOUBLE)
WITH (
    format = 'ORC',
    location = '/var/example_tables/test_table',
    orc_bloom_filter_columns = ARRAY['c1', 'c2'],
    orc_bloom_filter_fpp = 0.05)
```

(iceberg-metadata-tables)=

#### Metadata tables

The connector exposes several metadata tables for each Iceberg table. These
metadata tables contain information about the internal structure of the Iceberg
table. You can query each metadata table by appending the metadata table name to
the table name:

```
SELECT * FROM "test_table$properties"
```

##### `$properties` table

The `$properties` table provides access to general information about Iceberg
table configuration and any additional metadata key/value pairs that the table
is tagged with.

You can retrieve the properties of the current snapshot of the Iceberg table
`test_table` by using the following query:

```
SELECT * FROM "test_table$properties"
```

```text
 key                   | value    |
-----------------------+----------+
write.format.default   | PARQUET  |
```

##### `$history` table

The `$history` table provides a log of the metadata changes performed on the
Iceberg table.

You can retrieve the changelog of the Iceberg table `test_table` by using the
following query:

```
SELECT * FROM "test_table$history"
```

```text
 made_current_at                  | snapshot_id          | parent_id            | is_current_ancestor
----------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+--------------------
2022-01-10 08:11:20 Europe/Vienna | 8667764846443717831  |  <null>              |  true
2022-01-10 08:11:34 Europe/Vienna | 7860805980949777961  | 8667764846443717831  |  true
```

The output of the query has the following columns:

```{eval-rst}
.. list-table:: History columns
  :widths: 30, 30, 40
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Name
    - Type
    - Description
  * - ``made_current_at``
    - ``TIMESTAMP(3) WITH TIME ZONE``
    - The time when the snapshot became active.

##### `$snapshots` table

The `$snapshots` table provides a detailed view of snapshots of the Iceberg
table. A snapshot consists of one or more file manifests, and the complete table
contents are represented by the union of all the data files in those manifests.

You can retrieve the information about the snapshots of the Iceberg table
`test_table` by using the following query:

```
SELECT * FROM "test_table$snapshots"
```

```text

```

(iceberg-metadata-columns)=

#### Metadata columns

In addition to the defined columns, the Iceberg connector automatically exposes
path metadata as a hidden column in each table:

- `$path`: Full file system path name of the file for this row
- `$file_modified_time`: Timestamp of the last modification of the file for
  this row

You can use these columns in your SQL statements like any other column. This can
be selected directly, or used in conditional statements. For example, you can
inspect the file path for each record:

```
SELECT *, "$path", "$file_modified_time"
FROM example.web.page_views;
```

Retrieve all records that belong to a specific file using `"$path"` filter:

```
SELECT *
FROM example.web.page_views
WHERE "$path" = '/usr/iceberg/table/web.page_views/data/file_01.parquet'
```

Retrieve all records that belong to a specific file using
`"$file_modified_time"` filter:

```
SELECT *
FROM example.web.page_views
WHERE "$file_modified_time" = CAST('2022-07-01 01:02:03.456 UTC' AS TIMESTAMP WIOTH TIMEZONE)
```

#### DROP TABLE

The Iceberg connector supports dropping a table by using the
{doc}`/sql/drop-table` syntax. When the command succeeds, both the data of the
Iceberg table and also the information related to the table in the metastore
service are removed. Dropping tables that have their data/metadata stored in a
different location than the table's corresponding base directory on the object
store is not supported.

(iceberg-comment)=

#### COMMENT

The Iceberg connector supports setting comments on the following objects:

- tables
- views
- table columns
- materialized view columns

The `COMMENT` option is supported on both the table and the table columns for
the {doc}`/sql/create-table` operation.

The `COMMENT` option is supported for adding table columns through the
{doc}`/sql/alter-table` operations.

The connector supports the command {doc}`COMMENT </sql/comment>` for setting
comments on existing entities.

(iceberg-tables)=

#### Partitioned tables

Iceberg supports partitioning by specifying transforms over the table columns. A
partition is created for each unique tuple value produced by the transforms.
Identity transforms are simply the column name. Other transforms are:

```{eval-rst}
.. list-table:: Iceberg column transforms
  :widths: 40, 60
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Transform
    - Description
  * - ``year(ts)``
    - A partition is created for each year.  The partition value is the integer
      difference in years between ``ts`` and January 1 1970.
  * - ``month(ts)``
    - A partition is created for each month of each year.  The partition value
      is the integer difference in months between ``ts`` and January 1 1970.
  * - ``day(ts)``
    - A partition is created for each day of each year.  The partition value is
      the integer difference in days between ``ts`` and January 1 1970.
  * - ``hour(ts)``
    - A partition is created hour of each day.  The partition value is a
      timestamp with the minutes and seconds set to zero.
  * - ``bucket(x, nbuckets)``
    - The data is hashed into the specified number of buckets.  The partition
      value is an integer hash of ``x``, with a value between 0 and ``nbuckets -
      1`` inclusive.
  * - ``truncate(s, nchars)``
    - The partition value is the first ``nchars`` characters of ``s``.
```

In this example, the table is partitioned by the month of `order_date`, a hash
of `account_number` (with 10 buckets), and `country`:

```
CREATE TABLE example.testdb.customer_orders (
    order_id BIGINT,
    order_date DATE,
    account_number BIGINT,
    customer VARCHAR,
    country VARCHAR)
WITH (partitioning = ARRAY['month(order_date)', 'bucket(account_number, 10)', 'country'])
```

#### Sorted tables

The connector supports sorted files as a performance improvement. Data is sorted
during writes within each file based on the specified array of one or more
columns.

Sorting is particularly beneficial when the sorted columns show a high
cardinality and are used as a filter for selective reads.

The sort order is configured with the `sorted_by` table property. Specify an
array of one or more columns to use for sorting when creating the table. The
following example configures the `order_date` column of the `orders` table
in the `customers` schema in the `example` catalog:

```
CREATE TABLE example.customers.orders (
    order_id BIGINT,
    order_date DATE,
    account_number BIGINT,
    customer VARCHAR,
    country VARCHAR)
WITH (sorted_by = ARRAY['order_date'])
```

Sorting can be combined with partitioning on the same column. For example:

```
CREATE TABLE example.customers.orders (
    order_id BIGINT,
    order_date DATE,
    account_number BIGINT,
    customer VARCHAR,
    country VARCHAR)
WITH (
    partitioning = ARRAY['month(order_date)'],
    sorted_by = ARRAY['order_date']
)
```

You can disable sorted writing with the session property
`sorted_writing_enabled` set to `false`.

#### Using snapshots

Iceberg supports a snapshot model of data, where table snapshots are
identified by a snapshot ID.

The connector provides a system table exposing snapshot information for every
Iceberg table. Snapshots are identified by `BIGINT` snapshot IDs. For example,
you can find the snapshot IDs for the `customer_orders` table by running the
following query:

```
SELECT snapshot_id
FROM example.testdb."customer_orders$snapshots"
ORDER BY committed_at DESC
```

(iceberg-time-travel)=

##### Time travel queries

The connector offers the ability to query historical data. This allows you to
query the table as it was when a previous snapshot of the table was taken, even
if the data has since been modified or deleted.

The historical data of the table can be retrieved by specifying the snapshot
identifier corresponding to the version of the table to be retrieved:

```
SELECT *
FROM example.testdb.customer_orders FOR VERSION AS OF 8954597067493422955
```

A different approach of retrieving historical data is to specify a point in time
in the past, such as a day or week ago. The latest snapshot of the table taken
before or at the specified timestamp in the query is internally used for
providing the previous state of the table:

```
SELECT *
FROM example.testdb.customer_orders FOR TIMESTAMP AS OF TIMESTAMP '2022-03-23 09:59:29.803 Europe/Vienna'
```

You can use a date to specify a point a time in the past for using a snapshot of a table in a query.
Assuming that the session time zone is `Europe/Vienna` the following queries are equivalent:

```
SELECT *
FROM example.testdb.customer_orders FOR TIMESTAMP AS OF DATE '2022-03-23'
```

```
SELECT *
FROM example.testdb.customer_orders FOR TIMESTAMP AS OF TIMESTAMP '2022-03-23 00:00:00'
```

```
SELECT *
FROM example.testdb.customer_orders FOR TIMESTAMP AS OF TIMESTAMP '2022-03-23 00:00:00.000 Europe/Vienna'
```

Iceberg supports named references of snapshots via branches and tags.
Time travel can be performed to branches and tags in the table.

```
SELECT *
FROM example.testdb.customer_orders FOR VERSION AS OF 'historical-tag'

SELECT *
FROM example.testdb.customer_orders FOR VERSION AS OF 'test-branch'
```

##### Rolling back to a previous snapshot

Use the `$snapshots` metadata table to determine the latest snapshot ID of the
table like in the following query:

```
SELECT snapshot_id
FROM example.testdb."customer_orders$snapshots"
ORDER BY committed_at DESC LIMIT 1
```

The procedure `system.rollback_to_snapshot` allows the caller to roll back the
state of the table to a previous snapshot id:

```
CALL example.system.rollback_to_snapshot('testdb', 'customer_orders', 8954597067493422955)
```

#### `NOT NULL` column constraint

The Iceberg connector supports setting `NOT NULL` constraints on the table
columns.

The `NOT NULL` constraint can be set on the columns, while creating tables by
using the {doc}`CREATE TABLE </sql/create-table>` syntax:

```
CREATE TABLE example_table (
    year INTEGER NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    age INTEGER,
    address VARCHAR
);
```

When trying to insert/update data in the table, the query fails if trying to set
`NULL` value on a column having the `NOT NULL` constraint.

### View management

Trino allows reading from Iceberg materialized views.

(iceberg-materialized-views)=

#### Materialized views

The Iceberg connector supports {ref}`sql-materialized-view-management`. In the
underlying system, each materialized view consists of a view definition and an
Iceberg storage table. The storage table name is stored as a materialized view
property. The data is stored in that storage table.

You can use the {ref}`iceberg-table-properties` to control the created storage
table and therefore the layout and performance. For example, you can use the
following clause with {doc}`/sql/create-materialized-view` to use the ORC format
for the data files and partition the storage per day using the column
`_date`:

```
WITH ( format = 'ORC', partitioning = ARRAY['event_date'] )
```

By default, the storage table is created in the same schema as the materialized
view definition. The `iceberg.materialized-views.storage-schema` catalog
configuration property or `storage_schema` materialized view property can be
used to specify the schema where the storage table is created.

Creating a materialized view does not automatically populate it with data. You
must run {doc}`/sql/refresh-materialized-view` to populate data in the
materialized view.

Updating the data in the materialized view with `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`
deletes the data from the storage table, and inserts the data that is the result
of executing the materialized view query into the existing table. Data is
replaced atomically, so users can continue to query the materialized view while
it is being refreshed. Refreshing a materialized view also stores the
snapshot-ids of all Iceberg tables that are part of the materialized view's
query in the materialized view metadata. When the materialized view is queried,
the snapshot-ids are used to check if the data in the storage table is up to
date. If the data is outdated, the materialized view behaves like a normal view,
and the data is queried directly from the base tables. Detecting outdated data
is possible only when the materialized view uses Iceberg tables only, or when it
uses a mix of Iceberg and non-Iceberg tables but some Iceberg tables are outdated.
When the materialized view is based on non-Iceberg tables, querying it can
return outdated data, since the connector has no information whether the
underlying non-Iceberg tables have changed.

Dropping a materialized view with {doc}`/sql/drop-materialized-view` removes
the definition and the storage table.

## Fault-tolerant execution support

The connector supports {doc}`/admin/fault-tolerant-execution` of query
processing. Read and write operations are both supported with any retry policy.

## Performance

The connector includes a number of performance improvements, detailed in the
following sections.

### Table statistics

The Iceberg connector can collect column statistics using {doc}`/sql/analyze`
statement. This can be disabled using `iceberg.extended-statistics.enabled`
catalog configuration property, or the corresponding
`extended_statistics_enabled` session property.

#### Updating table statistics

If your queries are complex and include joining large data sets, running
{doc}`/sql/analyze` on tables may improve query performance by collecting
statistical information about the data:

```
ANALYZE table_name
```

This query collects statistics for all columns.

On wide tables, collecting statistics for all columns can be expensive. It is
also typically unnecessary - statistics are only useful on specific columns,
like join keys, predicates, or grouping keys. You can specify a subset of
columns to analyzed with the optional `columns` property:

```
ANALYZE table_name WITH (columns = ARRAY['col_1', 'col_2'])
```

This query collects statistics for columns `col_1` and `col_2`.

Note that if statistics were previously collected for all columns, they must be
dropped using the {ref}`drop_extended_stats <drop-extended-stats>` command
before re-analyzing.

(iceberg-table-redirection)=

### Table redirection

```{include} table-redirection.fragment
```

The connector supports redirection from Iceberg tables to Hive tables with the
`iceberg.hive-catalog-name` catalog configuration property.
