#### Predicate pushdown support

The connector does not support pushdown of any predicates on columns with
{ref}`textual types <string-data-types>` like `CHAR` or `VARCHAR`.
This ensures correctness of results since the data source may compare strings
case-insensitively.

In the following example, the predicate is not pushed down for either query
since `name` is a column of type `VARCHAR`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM nation WHERE name > 'CANADA';
SELECT * FROM nation WHERE name = 'CANADA';
```
