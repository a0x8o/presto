### Non-transactional INSERT

The connector supports adding rows using {doc}`INSERT statements </sql/insert>`.
By default, data insertion is performed by writing data to a temporary table.
You can skip this step to improve performance and write directly to the target
table. Set the `insert.non-transactional-insert.enabled` catalog property
or the corresponding `non_transactional_insert` catalog session property to
`true`.

Note that with this property enabled, data can be corrupted in rare cases where
exceptions occur during the insert operation. With transactions disabled, no
rollback can be performed.
