# Object storage file formats

Object storage connectors support one or more file formats specified by the
underlying data source.

In the case of serializable formats, only specific
[SerDes](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/SerDes) are allowed:

- RCText - RCFile `ColumnarSerDe`
- RCBinary - RCFile `LazyBinaryColumnarSerDe`
- JSON - `org.apache.hive.hcatalog.data.JsonSerDe`
- CSV - `org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde`

## ORC format configuration properties

The following properties are used to configure the read and write operations
with ORC files performed by supported object storage connectors:

```{eval-rst}
.. list-table:: ORC format configuration properties
    :widths: 30, 50, 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Property Name
      - Description
      - Default
    * - ``hive.orc.time-zone``
      - Sets the default time zone for legacy ORC files that did not declare a
        time zone.
      - JVM default
    * - ``hive.orc.use-column-names``
      - Access ORC columns by name. By default, columns in ORC files are
        accessed by their ordinal position in the Hive table definition. The
        equivalent catalog session property is ``orc_use_column_names``.
      - ``false``
    * - ``hive.orc.bloom-filters.enabled``
      - Enable bloom filters for predicate pushdown.
      - ``false``
    * - ``hive.orc.read-legacy-short-zone-id``
      - Allow reads on ORC files with short zone ID in the stripe footer.
      - ``false``
```

## Parquet format configuration properties

The following properties are used to configure the read and write operations
with Parquet files performed by supported object storage connectors:

```{eval-rst}
.. list-table:: Parquet format configuration properties
    :widths: 30, 50, 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Property Name
      - Description
      - Default
    * - ``hive.parquet.time-zone``
      - Adjusts timestamp values to a specific time zone. For Hive 3.1+, set
        this to UTC.
      - JVM default
    * - ``hive.parquet.use-column-names``
      - Access Parquet columns by name by default. Set this property to
        ``false`` to access columns by their ordinal position in the Hive table
        definition. The equivalent catalog session property is
        ``parquet_use_column_names``.
      - ``true``
    * - ``parquet.writer.validation-percentage``
      - Percentage of parquet files to validate after write by re-reading the whole file.
        The equivalent catalog session property is ``parquet_optimized_writer_validation_percentage``.
        Validation can be turned off by setting this property to ``0``.
      - ``5``
    * - ``parquet.writer.page-size``
      - Maximum page size for the Parquet writer.
      - ``1 MB``
    * - ``parquet.writer.block-size``
      - Maximum row group size for the Parquet writer.
      - ``128 MB``
    * - ``parquet.writer.batch-size``
      - Maximum number of rows processed by the parquet writer in a batch.
      - ``10000``
    * - ``parquet.use-bloom-filter``
      - Whether bloom filters are used for predicate pushdown when reading
        Parquet files. Set this property to ``false`` to disable the usage of
        bloom filters by default. The equivalent catalog session property is
        ``parquet_use_bloom_filter``.
      - ``true``
    * - ``parquet.use-column-index``
      - Skip reading Parquet pages by using Parquet column indices. The
        equivalent catalog session property is ``parquet_use_column_index``.
        Only supported by the Delta Lake and Hive connectors.
      - ``true``
    * - ``parquet.max-read-block-row-count``
      - Sets the maximum number of rows read in a batch. The equivalent catalog
        session property is named ``parquet_max_read_block_row_count`` and
        supported by the Delta Lake, Hive, and Iceberg connectors.
      - ``8192``
    * - ``parquet.small-file-threshold``
      - Size below which a parquet file will be read entirely. The equivalent
        catalog session property is named ``parquet_small_file_threshold``.
      - ``3MB``
