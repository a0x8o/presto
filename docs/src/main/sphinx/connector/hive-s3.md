# Hive connector with Amazon S3

The {doc}`hive` can read and write tables that are stored in
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or S3-compatible systems.
This is accomplished by having a table or database location that
uses an S3 prefix, rather than an HDFS prefix.

Trino uses its own S3 filesystem for the URI prefixes
`s3://`, `s3n://` and  `s3a://`.

(hive-s3-credentials)=

## S3 credentials

If you are running Trino on Amazon EC2, using EMR or another facility,
it is recommended that you use IAM Roles for EC2 to govern access to S3.
To enable this, your EC2 instances need to be assigned an IAM Role which
grants appropriate access to the data stored in the S3 bucket(s) you wish
to use. It is also possible to configure an IAM role with `hive.s3.iam-role`
that is used for accessing any S3 bucket. This is much cleaner than
setting AWS access and secret keys in the `hive.s3.aws-access-key`
and `hive.s3.aws-secret-key` settings, and also allows EC2 to automatically
rotate credentials on a regular basis without any additional work on your part.

## Custom S3 credentials provider

You can configure a custom S3 credentials provider by setting the configuration
property `trino.s3.credentials-provider` to the fully qualified class name of
a custom AWS credentials provider implementation. The property must be set in
the Hadoop configuration files referenced by the `hive.config.resources` Hive
connector property.

The class must implement the
[AWSCredentialsProvider](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/AWSCredentialsProvider.html)
interface and provide a two-argument constructor that takes a
`java.net.URI` and a Hadoop `org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration`
as arguments. A custom credentials provider can be used to provide
temporary credentials from STS (using `STSSessionCredentialsProvider`),
IAM role-based credentials (using `STSAssumeRoleSessionCredentialsProvider`),
or credentials for a specific use case (e.g., bucket/user specific credentials).

(hive-s3-security-mapping)=

## S3 security mapping

Trino supports flexible security mapping for S3, allowing for separate
credentials or IAM roles for specific users or buckets/paths. The IAM role
for a specific query can be selected from a list of allowed roles by providing
it as an *extra credential*.

Each security mapping entry may specify one or more match criteria. If multiple
criteria are specified, all criteria must match. Available match criteria:

- `user`: Regular expression to match against username. Example: `alice|bob`
- `group`: Regular expression to match against any of the groups that the user
  belongs to. Example: `finance|sales`
- `prefix`: S3 URL prefix. It can specify an entire bucket or a path within a
  bucket. The URL must start with `s3://` but will also match `s3a` or `s3n`.
  Example: `s3://bucket-name/abc/xyz/`

The security mapping must provide one or more configuration settings:

- `accessKey` and `secretKey`: AWS access key and secret key. This overrides
  any globally configured credentials, such as access key or instance credentials.
- `iamRole`: IAM role to use if no user provided role is specified as an
  extra credential. This overrides any globally configured IAM role. This role
  is allowed to be specified as an extra credential, although specifying it
  explicitly has no effect, as it would be used anyway.
- `roleSessionName`: Optional role session name to use with `iamRole`. This can only
  be used when `iamRole` is specified. If `roleSessionName` includes the string
  `${USER}`, then the `${USER}` portion of the string will be replaced with the
  current session's username. If `roleSessionName` is not specified, it defaults
  to `trino-session`.
- `allowedIamRoles`: IAM roles that are allowed to be specified as an extra
  credential. This is useful because a particular AWS account may have permissions
  to use many roles, but a specific user should only be allowed to use a subset
  of those roles.
- `kmsKeyId`: ID of KMS-managed key to be used for client-side encryption.
- `allowedKmsKeyIds`: KMS-managed key IDs that are allowed to be specified as an extra
  credential. If list cotains "\*", then any key can be specified via extra credential.

The security mapping entries are processed in the order listed in the configuration
JSON. More specific mappings should thus be specified before less specific mappings.
For example, the mapping list might have URL prefix `s3://abc/xyz/` followed by
`s3://abc/` to allow different configuration for a specific path within a bucket
than for other paths within the bucket. You can set default configuration by not
including any match criteria for the last entry in the list.

In addition to the rules above, the default mapping can contain the optional
`useClusterDefault` boolean property with the following behavior:

- `false` - (is set by default) property is ignored.

- `true` - This causes the default cluster role to be used as a fallback option.
  It can not be used with the following configuration properties:

  - `accessKey`
  - `secretKey`
  - `iamRole`
  - `allowedIamRoles`

If no mapping entry matches and no default is configured, the access is denied.

The configuration JSON can either be retrieved from a file or REST-endpoint specified via
`hive.s3.security-mapping.config-file`.

Example JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "mappings": [
    {
      "prefix": "s3://bucket-name/abc/",
      "iamRole": "arn:aws:iam::123456789101:role/test_path"

(hive-s3-data-encryption)=

## S3 data encryption

Trino supports reading and writing encrypted data in S3 using both
server-side encryption with S3 managed keys and client-side encryption using
either the Amazon KMS or a software plugin to manage AES encryption keys.

With [S3 server-side encryption](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html),
called *SSE-S3* in the Amazon documentation, the S3 infrastructure takes care of all encryption and decryption
work. One exception is SSL to the client, assuming you have `hive.s3.ssl.enabled` set to `true`.
S3 also manages all the encryption keys for you. To enable this, set `hive.s3.sse.enabled` to `true`.

With [S3 client-side encryption](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html),
S3 stores encrypted data and the encryption keys are managed outside of the S3 infrastructure. Data is encrypted
and decrypted by Trino instead of in the S3 infrastructure. In this case, encryption keys can be managed
either by using the AWS KMS, or your own key management system. To use the AWS KMS for key management, set
`hive.s3.kms-key-id` to the UUID of a KMS key. Your AWS credentials or EC2 IAM role will need to be
granted permission to use the given key as well.

To use a custom encryption key management system, set `hive.s3.encryption-materials-provider` to the
fully qualified name of a class which implements the
[EncryptionMaterialsProvider](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/model/EncryptionMaterialsProvider.html)
interface from the AWS Java SDK. This class has to be accessible to the Hive Connector through the
classpath and must be able to communicate with your custom key management system. If this class also implements
the `org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configurable` interface from the Hadoop Java API, then the Hadoop configuration
is passed in after the object instance is created, and before it is asked to provision or retrieve any
encryption keys.
