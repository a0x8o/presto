#### Predicate pushdown support

The connector does not support pushdown of inequality predicates, such as
`!=`, and range predicates such as `>`, or `BETWEEN`, on columns with
{ref}`character string types <string-data-types>` like `CHAR` or `VARCHAR`.
Equality predicates, such as `IN` or `=`, on columns with character string
types are pushed down. This ensures correctness of results since the remote data
source may sort strings differently than Trino.

In the following example, the predicate of the first and second query is not
pushed down since `name` is a column of type `VARCHAR` and `>` and `!=`
are range and inequality predicates respectively. The last query is pushed
down.

```sql
-- Not pushed down
SELECT * FROM nation WHERE name > 'CANADA';
SELECT * FROM nation WHERE name != 'CANADA';
-- Pushed down
SELECT * FROM nation WHERE name = 'CANADA';
```
