# Clients

A client is used to send queries to Trino and receive results, or otherwise
interact with Trino and the connected data sources.

Some clients, such as the {doc}`command line interface </client/cli>`, can
provide a user interface directly. Clients like the {doc}`JDBC driver
</client/jdbc>`, provide a mechanism for other tools to connect to Trino.

The following clients are available:

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

client/cli
client/jdbc
```

In addition, the community provides [numerous other clients](https://trino.io/resources.html) for platforms such as Python, and these
can in turn be used to connect applications using these platforms.
