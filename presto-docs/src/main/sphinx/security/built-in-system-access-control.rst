==============================
Built-in System Access Control
==============================

A system access control plugin enforces authorization at a global level,
before any connector level authorization. You can use one of the built-in
plugins in Presto, or provide your own by following the guidelines in
:doc:`/develop/system-access-control`.

Multiple system access control implementations may be configured at once
using the ``access-control.config-files`` configuration property. It should
contain a comma separated list of the access control property files to use
(rather than the default ``etc/access-control.properties``).

Presto offers three built-in plugins:

================================================== ============================================================
Plugin Name                                        Description
================================================== ============================================================
``allow-all`` (default value)                      All operations are permitted.

``read-only``                                      Operations that read data or metadata are permitted, but
                                                   none of the operations that write data or metadata are
                                                   allowed. See :ref:`read-only-system-access-control` for
                                                   details.

``file``                                           Authorization checks are enforced using a config file
                                                   specified by the configuration property ``security.config-file``.
                                                   See :ref:`file-based-system-access-control` for details.
================================================== ============================================================

Allow All System Access Control
===============================

All operations are permitted under this plugin. This plugin is enabled by default.

.. _read-only-system-access-control:

Read Only System Access Control
===============================

Under this plugin, you are allowed to execute any operation that reads data or
metadata, such as ``SELECT`` or ``SHOW``. Setting system level or catalog level
session properties is also permitted. However, any operation that writes data or
metadata, such as ``CREATE``, ``INSERT`` or ``DELETE``, is prohibited.
To use this plugin, add an ``etc/access-control.properties``
file with the following contents:

.. code-block:: none

   access-control.name=read-only

.. _file-based-system-access-control:

File Based System Access Control
================================

This plugin allows you to specify access control rules in a file. To use this
plugin, add an ``etc/access-control.properties`` file containing two required
properties: ``access-control.name``, which must be equal to ``file``, and
``security.config-file``, which must be equal to the location of the config file.
For example, if a config file named ``rules.json``
resides in ``etc``, add an ``etc/access-control.properties`` with the following
contents:

.. code-block:: none

   access-control.name=file
   security.config-file=etc/rules.json

The config file is specified in JSON format.

* It contains the rules defining which catalog can be accessed by which user (see Catalog Rules below).
* The query rules specifying which queries can be managed by which user (see Query Rules below).
* The impersonation rules specify which user impersonations are allowed (see Impersonation Rules below).
* The principal rules specifying what principals can identify as what users (see Principal Rules below).

This plugin currently supports catalog access, query, impersonation. and principal
rules. If you want to limit access on a system level in any other way, you
must implement a custom SystemAccessControl plugin
(see :doc:`/develop/system-access-control`).

Refresh
--------

By default, when a change is made to the ``security.config-file``, Presto must be restarted
to load the changes. There is an optional property to refresh the properties without requiring a
Presto restart. The refresh period is specified in the ``etc/access-control.properties``:

.. code-block:: none

   security.refresh-period=1s


Catalog Rules
-------------

These rules govern the catalogs particular users can access. The user is
granted access to a catalog, based on the first matching rule read from top to
bottom. If no rule matches, access is denied. Each rule is composed of the
following fields:

* ``user`` (optional): regex to match against user name. Defaults to ``.*``.
* ``group`` (optional): regex to match against group names. Defaults to ``.*``.
* ``catalog`` (optional): regex to match against catalog name. Defaults to ``.*``.
* ``allow`` (required): string indicating whether a user has access to the catalog.
  This value can be ``all``, ``read-only`` or ``none``, and defaults to ``none``.
  Setting this value to ``read-only`` has the same behavior as the ``read-only``
  system access control plugin.

In order for a rule to apply the user name must match the regular expression
specified in ``user`` attribute.

For group names, a rule can be applied if at least one group name of this user
matches the ``group`` regular expression.

.. note::

    By default, all users have access to the ``system`` catalog. You can
    override this behavior by adding a rule.

    Boolean ``true`` and ``false`` are also supported as legacy values for ``allow``,
    to support backwards compatibility.  ``true`` maps to ``all``, and ``false`` maps to ``none``.

For example, if you want to allow only the user ``admin`` to access the
``mysql`` and the ``system`` catalog, allow users from the ``finance``
and ``admin`` groups access to ``postgres`` catalog, allow all users to
access the ``hive`` catalog, and deny all other access, you can use the
following rules:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "catalogs": [
        {
          "user": "admin",
          "catalog": "(mysql|system)",
          "allow": "all"
        },
        {
          "group": "finance|human_resources",
          "catalog": "postgres",
          "allow": true
        },
        {
          "catalog": "hive",
          "allow": "all"
        },
        {
          "user": "alice",
          "catalog": "postgresql",
          "allow": "read-only"
        },
        {
          "catalog": "system",
          "allow": "none"
        }
      ]
    }

For group-based rules to match, users need to be assigned to groups by a
:doc:`/develop/group-provider`.

.. _query_rules:

Query Rules
-----------

These rules control the ability of a user to execute, view, or kill a query. The user is
granted or denied access, based on the first matching rule read from top to bottom. If no
rules are specified, all users are allowed to execute queries, and to view or kill queries
owned by any user. If no rule matches, query management is denied. Each rule is composed
of the following fields:

* ``user`` (optional): regex to match against user name. Defaults to ``.*``.
* ``owner`` (optional): regex to match against the query owner name. Defaults to ``.*``.
* ``allow`` (required): set of query permissions granted to user. Values: ``execute``, ``view``, ``kill``

.. note::

    Users always have permission to view or kill their own queries.

For example, if you want to allow the user ``admin`` full query access, allow the user ``alice``
to execute and kill queries, any user to execute queries, and deny all other access, you can use
the following rules:

.. literalinclude:: query-access.json
    :language: json

.. _impersonation_rules:

Impersonation Rules
-------------------

These rules control the ability of a user to impersonate another user.  In
some environments it is desirable for an administrator (or managed system) to
run queries on behalf of other users.  In these cases, the administrator
authenticates using their credentials, and then submits a query as a different
user.  When the user context is changed, Presto will verify the administrator
is authorized to run queries as the target user.

When these rules are present, the authorization is based on the first matching rule,
processed from top to bottom. If no rules match, the authorization is denied.
If impersonation rules are not present but the legacy principal rules are specified,
it is assumed impersonation access control is being handled by the principal rules,
so impersonation is allowed.  If neither impersonation nor principal rules are
defined, impersonation is not allowed.

Each impersonation rule is composed of the following fields:

* ``originalUser`` (required): regex to match against the user requesting the impersonation.
* ``newUser`` (required): regex to match against the user that will be impersonated.
* ``allow`` (optional): boolean indicating if the authentication should be allowed.

The following example allows the two admins, ``alice`` and ``bob``, to impersonate
any user, except they may not impersonate each other.  It also allows any user to
impersonate the ``test`` user:

.. literalinclude:: user-impersonation.json
    :language: json

.. _principal_rules:

Principal Rules
---------------

.. note::

    Principal rules are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
    These rules have been replaced with :doc:`/security/user-mapping`, which
    specifies how a complex authentication user name is mapped to a simple
    user name for Presto, and impersonation rules defined above.

These rules serve to enforce a specific matching between a principal and a
specified user name. The principal is granted authorization as a user, based
on the first matching rule read from top to bottom. If no rules are specified,
no checks are performed. If no rule matches, user authorization is denied.
Each rule is composed of the following fields:

* ``principal`` (required): regex to match and group against principal.
* ``user`` (optional): regex to match against user name. If matched, it
  will grant or deny the authorization based on the value of ``allow``.
* ``principal_to_user`` (optional): replacement string to substitute against
  principal. If the result of the substitution is same as the user name, it will
  grant or deny the authorization based on the value of ``allow``.
* ``allow`` (required): boolean indicating whether a principal can be authorized
  as a user.

.. note::

    You would at least specify one criterion in a principal rule. If you specify
    both criteria in a principal rule, it returns the desired conclusion when
    either of criteria is satisfied.

The following implements an exact matching of the full principal name for LDAP
and Kerberos authentication:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "catalogs": [
        {
          "allow": true
        }
      ],
      "principals": [
        {
          "principal": "(.*)",
          "principal_to_user": "$1",
          "allow": true
        },
        {
          "principal": "([^/]+)(/.*)?@.*",
          "principal_to_user": "$1",
          "allow": true
        }
      ]
    }

If you want to allow users to use the exact same name as their Kerberos principal
name, and allow ``alice`` and ``bob`` to use a group principal named as
``group@example.net``, you can use the following rules.

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "catalogs": [
        {
          "allow": true
        }
      ],
      "principals": [
        {
          "principal": "([^/]+)/?.*@example.net",
          "principal_to_user": "$1",
          "allow": true
        },
        {
          "principal": "group@example.net",
          "user": "alice|bob",
          "allow": true
        }
      ]
    }
