General Properties
------------------

``distributed-joins-enabled``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``boolean``
    * **Default value:** ``true``

    Use hash distributed joins instead of broadcast joins. Distributed joins
    require redistributing both tables using a hash of the join key. This can
    be slower (sometimes substantially) than broadcast joins, but allows much
    larger joins. Broadcast joins require that the tables on the right side of
    the join after filtering fit in memory on each node, whereas distributed joins
    only need to fit in distributed memory across all nodes. This can also be
    specified on a per-query basis using the ``distributed_join`` session property.

``redistribute-writes``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``boolean``
    * **Default value:** ``true``

    This property enables redistribution of data before writing. This can
    eliminate the performance impact of data skew when writing by hashing it
    across nodes in the cluster. It can be disabled when it is known that the
    output data set is not skewed in order to avoid the overhead of hashing and
    redistributing all the data across the network. This can also be specified
    on a per-query basis using the ``redistribute_writes`` session property.

``resources.reserved-system-memory``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``data size``
    * **Default value:** ``JVM max memory * 0.4``

    The amount of JVM memory reserved, for accounting purposes, for things
    that are not directly attributable to or controllable by a user query.
    For example, output buffers, code caches, etc. This also accounts for
    memory that is not tracked by the memory tracking system.

    The purpose of this property is to prevent the JVM from running out of
    memory (OOM). The default value is suitable for smaller JVM heap sizes or
    clusters with many concurrent queries. If running fewer queries with a
    large heap, a smaller value may work. Basically, set this value large
    enough that the JVM does not fail with ``OutOfMemoryError``.


.. _tuning-spilling:

Spilling Properties
-------------------

``experimental.spill-enabled``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``boolean``
    * **Default value:** ``false``

    Try spilling memory to disk to avoid exceeding memory limits for the query.

    Spilling works by offloading memory to disk. This process can allow a query with a large memory
    footprint to pass at the cost of slower execution times. Currently, spilling is supported only for
    aggregations and joins (inner and outer), so this property will not reduce memory usage required for
    window functions, sorting and other join types.

    Be aware that this is an experimental feature and should be used with care.

    This config property can be overridden by the ``spill_enabled`` session property.

``experimental.spiller-spill-path``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``string``
    * **No default value.** Must be set when spilling is enabled

    Directory where spilled content will be written. It can be a comma separated
    list to spill simultaneously to multiple directories, which helps to utilize
    multiple drives installed in the system.

    It is not recommended to spill to system drives. Most importantly, do not spill
    to the drive on which the JVM logs are written, as disk overutilization might
    cause JVM to pause for lengthy periods, causing queries to fail.

``experimental.spiller-max-used-space-threshold``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``double``
    * **Default value:** ``0.9``

    If disk space usage ratio of a given spill path is above this threshold,
    this spill path will not be eligible for spilling.

``experimental.spiller-threads``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Default value:** ``4``

    Number of spiller threads. Increase this value if the default is not able
    to saturate the underlying spilling device (for example, when using RAID).

``experimental.max-spill-per-node``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``data size``
    * **Default value:** ``100 GB``

    Max spill space to be used by all queries on a single node.

``experimental.query-max-spill-per-node``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``data size``
    * **Default value:** ``100 GB``

    Max spill space to be used by a single query on a single node.

``experimental.aggregation-operator-unspill-memory-limit``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``data size``
    * **Default value:** ``4 MB``

    Limit for memory used for unspilling a single aggregation operator instance.


Exchange Properties
-------------------

Exchanges transfer data between Presto nodes for different stages of
a query. Adjusting these properties may help to resolve inter-node
communication issues or improve network utilization.

``exchange.client-threads``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Minimum value:** ``1``
    * **Default value:** ``25``

    Number of threads used by exchange clients to fetch data from other Presto
    nodes. A higher value can improve performance for large clusters or clusters
    with very high concurrency, but excessively high values may cause a drop
    in performance due to context switches and additional memory usage.

``exchange.concurrent-request-multiplier``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Minimum value:** ``1``
    * **Default value:** ``3``

    Multiplier determining the number of concurrent requests relative to
    available buffer memory. The maximum number of requests is determined
    using a heuristic of the number of clients that can fit into available
    buffer space based on average buffer usage per request times this
    multiplier. For example, with an ``exchange.max-buffer-size`` of ``32 MB``
    and ``20 MB`` already used and average size per request being ``2MB``,
    the maximum number of clients is
    ``multiplier * ((32MB - 20MB) / 2MB) = multiplier * 6``. Tuning this
    value adjusts the heuristic, which may increase concurrency and improve
    network utilization.

``exchange.max-buffer-size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``data size``
    * **Default value:** ``32MB``

    Size of buffer in the exchange client that holds data fetched from other
    nodes before it is processed. A larger buffer can increase network
    throughput for larger clusters and thus decrease query processing time,
    but will reduce the amount of memory available for other usages.

``exchange.max-response-size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``data size``
    * **Minimum value:** ``1MB``
    * **Default value:** ``16MB``

    Maximum size of a response returned from an exchange request. The response
    will be placed in the exchange client buffer which is shared across all
    concurrent requests for the exchange.

    Increasing the value may improve network throughput if there is high
    latency. Decreasing the value may improve query performance for large
    clusters as it reduces skew due to the exchange client buffer holding
    responses for more tasks (rather than hold more data from fewer tasks).

``sink.max-buffer-size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``data size``
    * **Default value:** ``32MB``

    Output buffer size for task data that is waiting to be pulled by upstream
    tasks. If the task output is hash partitioned, then the buffer will be
    shared across all of the partitioned consumers. Increasing this value may
    improve network throughput for data transferred between stages if the
    network has high latency or if there are many nodes in the cluster.

.. _task-properties:

Task Properties
---------------

``task.concurrency``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Restrictions:** must be a power of two
    * **Default value:** ``16``

    Default local concurrency for parallel operators such as joins and aggregations.
    This value should be adjusted up or down based on the query concurrency and worker
    resource utilization. Lower values are better for clusters that run many queries
    concurrently because the cluster will already be utilized by all the running
    queries, so adding more concurrency will result in slow downs due to context
    switching and other overhead. Higher values are better for clusters that only run
    one or a few queries at a time. This can also be specified on a per-query basis
    using the ``task_concurrency`` session property.

``task.http-response-threads``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Minimum value:** ``1``
    * **Default value:** ``100``

    Maximum number of threads that may be created to handle HTTP responses. Threads are
    created on demand and are cleaned up when idle, thus there is no overhead to a large
    value if the number of requests to be handled is small. More threads may be helpful
    on clusters with a high number of concurrent queries, or on clusters with hundreds
    or thousands of workers.

``task.http-timeout-threads``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Minimum value:** ``1``
    * **Default value:** ``3``

    Number of threads used to handle timeouts when generating HTTP responses. This value
    should be increased if all the threads are frequently in use. This can be monitored
    via the ``com.facebook.presto.server:name=AsyncHttpExecutionMBean:TimeoutExecutor``
    JMX object. If ``ActiveCount`` is always the same as ``PoolSize``, increase the
    number of threads.

``task.info-update-interval``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``duration``
    * **Minimum value:** ``1ms``
    * **Maximum value:** ``10s``
    * **Default value:** ``3s``

    Controls staleness of task information, which is used in scheduling. Larger values
    can reduce coordinator CPU load, but may result in suboptimal split scheduling.

``task.max-partial-aggregation-memory``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``data size``
    * **Default value:** ``16MB``

    Maximum size of partial aggregation results for distributed aggregations. Increasing this
    value can result in less network transfer and lower CPU utilization by allowing more
    groups to be kept locally before being flushed, at the cost of additional memory usage.

``task.max-worker-threads``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Default value:** ``Node CPUs * 2``

    Sets the number of threads used by workers to process splits. Increasing this number
    can improve throughput if worker CPU utilization is low and all the threads are in use,
    but will cause increased heap space usage. Setting the value too high may cause a drop
    in performance due to a context switching. The number of active threads is available
    via the ``RunningSplits`` property of the
    ``com.facebook.presto.execution.executor:name=TaskExecutor.RunningSplits`` JXM object.

``task.min-drivers``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Default value:** ``task.max-worker-threads * 2``

    The target number of running leaf splits on a worker. This is a minimum value because
    each leaf task is guaranteed at least ``3`` running splits. Non-leaf tasks are also
    guaranteed to run in order to prevent deadlocks. A lower value may improve responsiveness
    for new tasks, but can result in underutilized resources. A higher value can increase
    resource utilization, but uses additional memory.

``task.writer-count``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Restrictions:** must be a power of two
    * **Default value:** ``1``

    The number of concurrent writer threads per worker per query. Increasing this value may
    increase write speed, especially when a query is not I/O bound and can take advantage
    of additional CPU for parallel writes (some connectors can be bottlenecked on CPU when
    writing due to compression or other factors). Setting this too high may cause the cluster
    to become overloaded due to excessive resource utilization. This can also be specified on
    a per-query basis using the ``task_writer_count`` session property.


Node Scheduler Properties
-------------------------

``node-scheduler.max-splits-per-node``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Default value:** ``100``

    The target value for the total number of splits that can be running for
    each worker node.

    Using a higher value is recommended if queries are submitted in large batches
    (e.g., running a large group of reports periodically) or for connectors that
    produce many splits that complete quickly. Increasing this value may improve
    query latency by ensuring that the workers have enough splits to keep them
    fully utilized.

    Setting this too high will waste memory and may result in lower performance
    due to splits not being balanced across workers. Ideally, it should be set
    such that there is always at least one split waiting to be processed, but
    not higher.

``node-scheduler.max-pending-splits-per-task``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Default value:** ``10``

    The number of outstanding splits that can be queued for each worker node
    for a single stage of a query, even when the node is already at the limit for
    total number of splits. Allowing a minimum number of splits per stage is
    required to prevent starvation and deadlocks.

    This value must be smaller than ``node-scheduler.max-splits-per-node``,
    will usually be increased for the same reasons, and has similar drawbacks
    if set too high.

``node-scheduler.min-candidates``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Minimum value:** ``1``
    * **Default value:** ``10``

    The minimum number of candidate nodes that will be evaluated by the
    node scheduler when choosing the target node for a split. Setting
    this value too low may prevent splits from being properly balanced
    across all worker nodes. Setting it too high may increase query
    latency and increase CPU usage on the coordinator.

``node-scheduler.network-topology``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``string``
    * **Allowed values:** ``legacy``, ``flat``
    * **Default value:** ``legacy``


Optimizer Properties
--------------------

``optimizer.dictionary-aggregation``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``boolean``
    * **Default value:** ``false``

    Enables optimization for aggregations on dictionaries. This can also be specified
    on a per-query basis using the ``dictionary_aggregation`` session property.

``optimizer.optimize-hash-generation``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``boolean``
    * **Default value:** ``true``

    Compute hash codes for distribution, joins, and aggregations early during execution,
    allowing result to be shared between operations later in the query. This can reduce
    CPU usage by avoiding computing the same hash multiple times, but at the cost of
    additional network transfer for the hashes. In most cases it will decrease overall
    query processing time. This can also be specified on a per-query basis using the
    ``optimize_hash_generation`` session property.

    It is often helpful to disable this property when using :doc:`/sql/explain` in order
    to make the query plan easier to read.

``optimizer.optimize-metadata-queries``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``boolean``
    * **Default value:** ``false``

    Enable optimization of some aggregations by using values that are stored as metadata.
    This allows Presto to execute some simple queries in constant time. Currently, this
    optimization applies to ``max``, ``min`` and ``approx_distinct`` of partition
    keys and other aggregation insensitive to the cardinality of the input (including
    ``DISTINCT`` aggregates). Using this may speed up some queries significantly.

    The main drawback is that it can produce incorrect results if the connector returns
    partition keys for partitions that have no rows. In particular, the Hive connector
    can return empty partitions if they were created by other systems (Presto cannot
    create them).

``optimizer.optimize-single-distinct``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``boolean``
    * **Default value:** ``true``

    The single distinct optimization will try to replace multiple ``DISTINCT`` clauses
    with a single ``GROUP BY`` clause, which can be substantially faster to execute.

``optimizer.push-aggregation-through-join``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``boolean``
    * **Default value:** ``true``

    When an aggregation is above an outer join and all columns from the outer side of the join
    are in the grouping clause, the aggregation is pushed below the outer join. This optimization
    is particularly useful for correlated scalar subqueries, which get rewritten to an aggregation
    over an outer join. For example::

        SELECT * FROM item i
            WHERE i.i_current_price > (
                SELECT AVG(j.i_current_price) FROM item j
                    WHERE i.i_category = j.i_category);

    Enabling this optimization can substantially speed up queries by reducing
    the amount of data that needs to be processed by the join.  However, it may slow down some
    queries that have very selective joins. This can also be specified on a per-query basis using
    the ``push_aggregation_through_join`` session property.

``optimizer.push-table-write-through-union``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``boolean``
    * **Default value:** ``true``

    Parallelize writes when using ``UNION ALL`` in queries that write data. This improves the
    speed of writing output tables in ``UNION ALL`` queries because these writes do not require
    additional synchronization when collecting results. Enabling this optimization can improve
    ``UNION ALL`` speed when write speed is not yet saturated. However, it may slow down queries
    in an already heavily loaded system. This can also be specified on a per-query basis
    using the ``push_table_write_through_union`` session property.


Regular Expression Function Properties
--------------------------------------

The following properties allow tuning the :doc:`/functions/regexp`.

``regex-library``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``string``
    * **Allowed values:** ``JONI``, ``RE2J``
    * **Default value:** ``JONI``

    Which library to use for regular expression functions.
    ``JONI`` is generally faster for common usage, but can require exponential
    time for certain expression patterns. ``RE2J`` uses a different algorithm
    which guarantees linear time, but is often slower.

``re2j.dfa-states-limit``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Minimum value:** ``2``
    * **Default value:** ``2147483647``

    The maximum number of states to use when RE2J builds the fast
    but potentially memory intensive deterministic finite automaton (DFA)
    for regular expression matching. If the limit is reached, RE2J will fall
    back to the algorithm that uses the slower, but less memory intensive
    non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA). Decreasing this value decreases the
    maximum memory footprint of a regular expression search at the cost of speed.

``re2j.dfa-retries``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Minimum value:** ``0``
    * **Default value:** ``5``

    The number of times that RE2J will retry the DFA algorithm when
    it reaches a states limit before using the slower, but less memory
    intensive NFA algorithm for all future inputs for that search. If hitting the
    limit for a given input row is likely to be an outlier, you want to be able
    to process subsequent rows using the faster DFA algorithm. If you are likely
    to hit the limit on matches for subsequent rows as well, you want to use the
    correct algorithm from the beginning so as not to waste time and resources.
    The more rows you are processing, the larger this value should be.
